Lisu Bosa v2.000 - First full release

This is the first full release of the complete *Lisu Bosa* and *Lisu Bosa Lolo* font families. These fonts support the complete range of Unicode characters for the Lisu (Fraser) script. They include:

- Eight weights from ExtraLight to Black in both upright and italic styles (only in *Lisu Bosa*).
- A second font family - *Lisu Bosa Lolo* - in a separate package. It contains only the Light and SemiBold weights, which have been renamed to Regular and Bold to support older applications.
- A basic set of Latin glyphs mainly for compatibility and occasional use. These are intended to contrast strongly from the Lisu and are based on *Source Serif*.
- OpenType (TTF) fonts for desktop use and WOFF and WOFF2 versions for the web.

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in all-platforms packages on the [Download page](https://software.sil.org/lisubosa/download).
